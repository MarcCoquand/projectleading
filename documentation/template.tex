Walking home late at night can be a daunting experience. The newspapers write
about assaults and harassment, the northern winter climate contribute with
shorter days and darker nights. Existing street lights helps with the problem
but the feeling of uncertainty and fear persist. $PROJECTNAME$ will investigate
how a technical solution could be applied to create an increased sense of
safety. The project is carried out in collaboration with the municipality of
Umeå and Umeå University as part of the courses Interactivity in Smart
Environments and Project Management.
